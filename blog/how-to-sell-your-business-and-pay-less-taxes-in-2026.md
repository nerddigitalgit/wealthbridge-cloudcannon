After years of building your business, the decision to sell is both exciting and terrifying. You've created something valuable, and now you're about to realize that value in a life-changing transaction.

But here's what most entrepreneurs don't fully appreciate until it's too late: **without proper tax planning, you could hand over 30-50% of your sale proceeds to the CRA.**

In 2026, with the recent changes to capital gains taxation in Canada, the stakes have never been higher. Let's break down how to keep more of what you've built.

## Understanding the Tax Landscape for Business Sales

When you sell your business, the proceeds are generally taxed as capital gains. In Canada, the inclusion rate and your marginal tax rate combine to determine what you actually keep.

### The Capital Gains Reality

For a successful business sale, you could be looking at:

* **Capital gains inclusion**: A portion of your gain is added to your income
* **Provincial + Federal taxes**: Combined rates vary by province
* **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)**: Can catch high-value transactions

For a business owner in Ontario selling for $5 million, poor planning could mean paying well over $1 million in taxes. Proper planning could reduce that significantly.

## The Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE)

The single most powerful tool for business sellers is the **Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption**. In 2026, this exemption allows qualifying small business owners to shelter a significant portion of their capital gains from tax.

### Qualifying for the LCGE

To use this exemption, your business must meet several criteria:

1. **Qualified Small Business Corporation (QSBC)** status
2. **90% or more of assets** must be used in active business
3. **24-month holding period** requirement
4. **50% asset test** throughout the holding period

### Common LCGE Traps

Many entrepreneurs assume they'll qualify automatically - and discover too late that they don't. Here are the most common issues:

**Excess Passive Investments**: If your corporation holds too many passive investments (stocks, bonds, rental properties), it may fail the 90% active business asset test.

**Holding Period Violations**: The 24-month holding requirement applies to you personally. If you restructured ownership recently, you might not qualify.

**Corporate Structure Issues**: How your business is structured matters. Holding company arrangements need careful planning to preserve LCGE eligibility.

## Multiplying the Exemption Through Family

One of the most powerful (and legal) tax planning strategies involves multiplying the LCGE across family members.

### How It Works

If structured properly, each family member who owns shares can potentially claim their own LCGE. For a family of four, this could mean sheltering significantly more of your business sale from tax.

### The Planning Requirements

This strategy requires **advance planning** - typically 2+ years before the sale:

1. **Family trust structures** must be in place
2. **Income splitting rules** must be navigated carefully
3. **Attribution rules** must be avoided
4. **Documentation** must be meticulous

Attempting to implement this strategy at the last minute often fails due to anti-avoidance rules.

## Asset Sale vs. Share Sale

The structure of your sale dramatically impacts your tax outcome.

### Share Sale Benefits

Selling shares rather than assets typically provides:

* **LCGE eligibility**: Only available on share sales
* **Single layer of tax**: Proceeds go directly to shareholders
* **Cleaner exit**: Liabilities stay with the corporation

### Asset Sale Considerations

Buyers often prefer asset purchases because:

* They can step up the tax cost of assets
* They don't inherit unknown liabilities
* They can cherry-pick desired assets

The tax cost difference between asset and share sales can be substantial. This is often a key negotiation point in deal structuring.

## The Earn-Out Trap

Many business sales include earn-out provisions - additional payments contingent on future performance. While these can maximize total sale price, they create tax complications:

* **Uncertain timing** of income recognition
* **Potential for ordinary income treatment** vs. capital gains
* **Cash flow challenges** - you may owe tax before receiving payment

Proper structuring of earn-outs is essential for tax efficiency.

## Pre-Sale Purification Strategies

If your corporation holds excess passive assets, you may need to "purify" it before sale to maintain QSBC status. Options include:

### Dividend Out Excess Investments

Pay dividends to remove passive investments from the corporation. This triggers immediate tax but may preserve LCGE eligibility worth far more.

### Transfer to Holding Company

In some cases, you can transfer passive investments to a holding company, leaving the operating company clean for sale.

### Time the Sale Appropriately

If passive assets are temporary (e.g., you recently received a large customer payment), timing the sale after these assets are deployed in the business can help.

## Post-Sale Wealth Structuring

The work doesn't end when the deal closes. How you manage the proceeds determines your long-term wealth:

### Immediate Considerations

* **Tax installment planning**: Avoid penalties and interest
* **Investment strategy**: Where does the cash go?
* **Estate planning**: Protect wealth for future generations

### Common Post-Sale Mistakes

1. **Investing too quickly** without a clear strategy
2. **Ignoring tax-efficient structures** for ongoing wealth management
3. **Lifestyle inflation** that depletes the nest egg
4. **Failing to diversify** out of concentrated positions

## The Exit Planning Timeline

Here's what proper exit planning looks like:

### 3-5 Years Before Sale

* Review corporate structure
* Implement family trust planning if appropriate
* Begin purification if needed
* Document everything

### 1-2 Years Before Sale

* Confirm QSBC status
* Clean up any structural issues
* Prepare for due diligence
* Engage professional advisors

### 6-12 Months Before Sale

* Final structure optimization
* Negotiate deal terms with tax in mind
* Coordinate with legal and accounting teams
* Plan for proceeds investment

### At Close

* Execute planned structure
* Manage cash flow for tax payments
* Begin wealth management transition

## The Cost of Waiting

The most expensive mistake in exit planning is waiting too long. Many strategies require years of advance planning to be effective.

**Example**: A business owner who wants to multiply the LCGE across family members but only starts planning 6 months before sale will likely find it's too late. The same planning done 3 years earlier could have saved hundreds of thousands in taxes.

## Key Takeaways for 2026 Business Sellers

1. **Start planning NOW** - most strategies require advance implementation
2. **Verify QSBC status** - don't assume you qualify
3. **Understand the math** - model different scenarios before negotiating
4. **Structure the deal for tax efficiency** - share vs. asset, earn-outs, etc.
5. **Plan for the proceeds** - the sale is just the beginning
6. **Work with specialists** - this is not a DIY situation

## Your Keep Rate on a Business Sale

At WealthBridge, we help entrepreneurs understand their true Keep Rate on business sales. This means looking beyond the headline sale price to understand:

* What you'll actually receive after taxes
* How different structures change the outcome
* What planning opportunities still exist
* How to protect and grow the proceeds

The difference between good and poor planning on a $5 million business sale could easily exceed $500,000. On larger transactions, the stakes are even higher.
