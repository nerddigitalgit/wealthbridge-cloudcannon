      "question": "How is Wealth Bridge different from my bank's wealth management?",
      "answer": "Banks typically focus on investment management - deploying money after it's already flowed through your personal tax return. Wealth Bridge starts differently: we look at your full financial ecosystem - how income is earned, how it flows through your corporation, how many layers of tax it passes through. Our focus is your keep rate before layering in growth strategies. We coordinate across tax, corporate structure, liquidity, and investment strategy - ensuring decisions are aligned, sequenced, and intentional. For business owners with growing complexity, that coordination is often the missing piece."

    {
      "question": "Is this legal? It sounds too good to be true.",
      "answer": "Yes - when done properly, these strategies are legal and well-established within Canadian tax law. The planning approaches we use - including corporate structuring, tax deferral mechanisms, and permanent insurance - are grounded in existing Canadian legislation and CRA-recognized frameworks. They've been used by business owners and families for decades. What matters is how they're implemented: structured correctly, aligned with CRA rules, and coordinated with professional tax and legal advice. We emphasize proper documentation, transparency, and suitability based on your specific situation. Good planning should feel clear, not risky or rushed."

      "question": "How does Wealth Bridge make money?",
      "answer": "We focus on creating financial clarity first, and only move forward if there's a meaningful opportunity to help. That's why the Keep Rate Audit is complimentary - it allows us to understand your situation and determine whether coordinated planning could materially improve your outcome. If we don't see a clear way to add value, we'll tell you. When clients do choose to work with us, compensation may come from the implementation of planning strategies (such as insurance-based solutions) and ongoing investment management, if engaged. Our incentive is long-term outcomes and relationships, not volume."

    {
      "question": "How much do I need to get started?",
      "answer": "There's no single number - what matters most is surplus cash flow. These strategies become relevant once your business consistently generates more than you need to live on personally. Our work is best suited for Canadian business owners who generate $500K-$10M in annual gross business income and have built a net worth of $3M+ (including real estate), or are clearly on that trajectory. The scale matters - but structure, timing, and intent matter more. The Keep Rate Audit helps determine whether these strategies are suitable now, how much surplus exists, and whether planning would meaningfully improve your outcome."

      "question": "Why should I trust Wealth Bridge with my wealth?",
      "answer": "Trust in wealth planning comes from alignment, independence, and process - not promises. We work with a multidisciplinary team of professionals with over 50 years of combined experience, including Certified Financial Planners, financial analysts, accountants, and insurance specialists. We're not tied to a single bank or provider - we partner with all major Canadian banks and leading insurance companies, allowing us to recommend solutions based on fit, not affiliation. The strategies we discuss aren't theoretical - they're approaches we've implemented thoughtfully and refined through real-world experience. We begin with the Keep Rate Audit to determine whether working together would meaningfully improve your position. If it won't, we'll tell you."
