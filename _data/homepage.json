      "I left my job as an Ontario Treasury Board Analyst to build something of my own. My first year in business, I earned just over $200,000. It felt like success, until tax season, when a huge portion disappeared.",
      "My business counterpart, same market, earned seven figures and kept most of it. The difference wasn't effort. It was structure.",
      "I was too \"small\" for private wealth firms. Too complex for bank advice. No one explained how tax, incorporation, and planning work together. So, I learned the hard way, and made expensive mistakes along the way.",
      "But those mistakes taught me something: wealth isn't just built by earning more. It's built by keeping more.",
      "As a first-generation Iranian Canadian immigrant, I'd already spent my life navigating systems that weren't designed for people like me. I knew what it felt like to be overlooked or pushed into cookie-cutter solutions.",
      "And I saw it happening everywhere - to women entrepreneurs, visible minorities, and other immigrants.",
      "That's why I founded Wealth Bridge Consulting.",
      "We close the wealth gap between what you earn and what you keep, by designing smarter structures without the guesswork. We shift the decision power back to you, where it belongs.",
      "If you've built a successful business but feel like wealth should be easier, you're not behind. You're ready for a better framework.",
      "We offer a complimentary Keep Rate Audit to show you where wealth may be quietly leaking. No pressure. Just clarity.",
      "Your success isn't a transaction. It's a transformation."
